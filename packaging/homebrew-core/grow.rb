# Upstream (Homebrew/homebrew-core) formula variant for Grow.
#
# Differs from packaging/harmonybrew/grow.rb (the OpenHarmony port):
#   - default features ON (jemalloc + sandbox-enforce, matching the official
#     release builds); only distro-pm is added to disable self-update
#   - no `depends_on "zsh"`: macOS ships zsh, Linux falls back to bash
# The source tarball carries the vendored crates (third_party/nix-ohos etc.);
# their patches are behavior-neutral on macOS/Linux and exist for the
# OpenHarmony target (Harmonybrew port), which upstream cannot build.
