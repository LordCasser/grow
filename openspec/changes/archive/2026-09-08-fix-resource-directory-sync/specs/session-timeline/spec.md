## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Local resource publication syncs a usable directory handle
Acknowledged local resource persistence SHALL synchronize the published parent directory using a sync-capable descriptor relative to its pinned directory capability. Failures after publication SHALL remain distinguishable from pre-publication failures.

#### Scenario: Persist resources on Linux
- **WHEN** resource state is atomically published and durable acknowledgement is requested
- **THEN** directory synchronization succeeds for a valid writable store even if its original capability descriptor uses O_PATH.
